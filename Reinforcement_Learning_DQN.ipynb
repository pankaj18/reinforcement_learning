        "\n",
        "The fundamental principle behind RL is we have two entities: the **agent** and the **environment**. The agent takes state and reward information about the envionment and chooses an action. The environment takes that action and will change to be in a new state.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "RL assumes that the environment follows a [Markov Decision Process (MDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process). That means the state is dependent partially on the agent's actions, and partially on chance. MDPs can be represented by a graph, with states and actions as nodes, and rewards and path probabilities on the edges.\n",

        "\n",

        "So what would be the best path through the graph above? Or perhaps a more difficult question, what would be our expected winnings if we played optimally? The probability introduced in this problem has inspired multiple strategies over the years, but all of them boil down to the idea of discounted future rewards.\n",

        "Would you rather have `$100` now or `$105` a year from now? With inflation, there's no definitive answer, but each of us has a threshold that we use to determine the value of something now versus the value of something later. In psychology, this is called [Delayed Gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification). Richard E. Bellman expressed this theory in an equation widely used in RL called the [Bellman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation). Let's introduce some vocab to better define it.\n",
